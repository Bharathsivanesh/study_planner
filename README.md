## Project Overview
The **AI Study Planner** is an intelligent application designed to help students manage their study schedules based on their exams, the difficulty of subjects, and their learning progress. The system uses an AI prioritization model to suggest topics and study strategies that maximize productivity and learning.

### Key Features:
- **Prioritization System**: Ranks study topics based on exam dates, difficulty, and user history.
- **AI Integration**: Uses a Python-based AI model to enhance the prioritization system.
- **User Profiles**: Allows users to track their study progress and history.
- **Mobile Integration**: Future enhancements may include mobile app integration for on-the-go learning.

## Features

### User Features
- **Create & Manage Study Plan**: Users can input their exam dates, subject list, and difficulty levels to generate a personalized study plan.
- **Track Progress**: Users can track their study progress and update completed topics.
- **Prioritize Topics**: The app will suggest which topics to study next based on the AI systemâ€™s recommendations.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications on upcoming exams and deadlines.

### AI Features
- **Prioritize Study Topics**: The AI model ranks the topics based on exam schedules, difficulty, and learning progress.
- **Learning Model**: The AI continuously learns from user input and performance to improve suggestions over time.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components and layout.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend server.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building the API.
- **Python (FastAPI, Uvicorn)**: For the AI prioritization model and data scoring.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data, exam schedules, and study plans.

### Additional Tools:
